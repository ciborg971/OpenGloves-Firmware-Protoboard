# OpenGloves Firmware
This is a firmware implementation meant to work with the [Steam VR Driver OpenGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/opengloves-driver). It is meant to support many different types of hardware and can be configured to work with specific implementations.

# Firmware
Follow the instruction from LucidGloves, except use the firmware files in this repository.

Open the firmware files located in the open-gloves folder.
By default the firmware is configured for an arduino ESP32 using serial.
To configure the firmware, change the defines in the Config.h file.

**Configuration instructions are here: [Configuration Instructions](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Firmware-Setup-and-Customization-Tutorial/).**
